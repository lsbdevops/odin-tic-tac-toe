# Tic Tac Toe!

A two-player web based game, created as part of "The Odin Project".

Learnings from this project:
- Organising code using factory functions and module pattern (IIFEs).
- Keeping properties private / not directly changeable to reduce bugs.
- Use of "signal" and "AbortController" to remove multiple event listeners.
- Further use of dialogs to capture and display information.
- Further interaction between the DOM and code.
